# Introduction
Hi, my name is [DiscworldZA](). I create GTA V mods for FiveM

This is my repo for all the mods I create.
Feedback is highly recommended.

Want a Mod or Feature? [Here](https://github.com/DiscworldZA/gta-resources/issues)
I will create almost anything you can think of. Feel free to request it and I will see about creating it.

Changelog [here](https://github.com/DiscworldZA/gta-resources/blob/master/changelog.md)

# Explanation
Most of my mods work with the [Base](https://github.com/DiscworldZA/gta-resources/tree/master/disc-base) mod and [ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)

The reasoning behind this is to simplify my process and have all my mods up to the same standard and address bug fixing over the whole platform rather individual broken sections.
It is the same concept that [ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended) works on but for all my needs.

Most server owners are not developers but understand the basics. My mods are created highly configurable. Every Location and Price for the mods will be able to be configured. If you want more configuration options create an issue!

# Requirements for all mods
- [ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)
- [Mythic Notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify)
